When selecting `Layers` tab in the GUI on CURRENT, the application crushes.

<jemalloc>: jemalloc_rtree.c:205: Failed assertion: "!dependent || leaf != NULL"

Also, at exit, it crushes, too.

<jemalloc>: /usr/src/contrib/jemalloc/include/jemalloc/internal/extent_inlines.h:63: Failed assertion: "szind < NSIZES"

Unfortunately, these issues cannot be diagnosed until another issue in lldb(1)
is fixed.
